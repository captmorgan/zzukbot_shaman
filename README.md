-------------------

How to use:

Set Rest parameters:
Eat At 1% (dont use food because Intelligent Healing will manage HP)
Set Drink at 15%, adjust to 10-20% depending on mob difficulty.

Search mob range: 45

Roam from Waypoint: 100-200 depending on profile size. 

Force break after 60-120 please dont bot AFK, or let bags fill. Vendoring will NOT work once you have ghost wolf (lvl 20).

Make sure Loot Units is ON once lvl 20.

Talent spec: go enhancement, then go elemental. http://db.vanillagaming.org/?talent#hEcu0c0oZVVfzV0ux

This is a defensive spec that can handle multiple mobs without dying. so choose items accordingly. Use a dagger/shield for weapon.
Take the gear with the best stats, dont worry about min/max. Shamans are a hybrid, and this will take advantage of all stats. 

Add Cure poison or Disease to these subroutines:

cureDisease() curePoison() 

Add any mob buffs to the purgeBuffs() routine.
